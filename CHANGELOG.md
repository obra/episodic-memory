## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- **Issue #10**: Fixed SessionStart hook configuration that prevented memory sync from running
  - Removed invalid `args` property from hook configuration
  - Added `async: true` and `--background` flag to prevent blocking Claude startup
- **Issue #5**: Fixed summary generation failure during sync command
  - Resolved confusion between archived conversation IDs and active session IDs
  - Sync now properly generates summaries for archived conversations
- **Issue #9**: Fixed better-sqlite3 Node.js version compatibility issues
  - Added postinstall script to automatically rebuild native modules
  - Resolves NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch errors on Node.js v25+
- **Issue #8**: Fixed version mismatch between git tags and marketplace.json
  - Synchronized plugin version metadata with release tags

### Added
- Background sync mode with `--background` flag for non-blocking operation
- Automatic native module rebuilding for cross-Node.js version compatibility
- Enhanced CLI help documentation with background mode usage examples

### Changed
- SessionStart hook now uses `episodic-memory sync --background` for instant startup
- Sync command forks to background process when `--background` flag is used
- Improved hook configuration follows Claude Code hook specification exactly
- Updated marketplace.json versions in both embedded and superpowers-marketplace locations

### Security
- Fixed potential process blocking during Claude Code startup
- Improved process detachment for background operations

## [1.0.6] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- **Issue #1**: Fixed Windows CLI execution failure by replacing bash scripts with cross-platform Node.js implementation
- **Issue #4**: Fixed sqlite-vec extension loading error on macOS ARM64 and Linux by adding `--external:sqlite-vec` to esbuild configuration
- Resolved "Loadable extension for sqlite-vec not found" error on affected platforms

### Added
- Cross-platform CLI support using Node.js instead of bash scripts
- Enhanced error handling with clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- Automatic dependency validation (npx, tsx) in CLI tools
- Proper symlink resolution for npm link and global installations

### Changed
- CLI entry points now use `.js` extension for universal compatibility
- Replaced `shell: true` spawn calls with direct spawn for improved security
- Updated build configuration to externalize sqlite-vec native module
- Improved process execution without shell interpretation to prevent command injection

### Security
- Removed shell dependencies from CLI execution
- Added input validation and protection against command injection vulnerabilities
- Safer process execution using direct spawn calls

## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- MCP server wrapper now deletes package-lock.json before npm install to ensure platform-specific sqlite-vec packages are installed
- Resolves "Loadable extension for sqlite-vec not found" error on fresh plugin installs

### Changed
- Add package-lock.json to .gitignore to prevent cross-platform optional dependency issues
- Improve wrapper script to handle npm's platform-specific optional dependency installation behavior

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-23

### Changed
- Strengthen agent and MCP tool descriptions to emphasize memory restoration
- Use empowering "this restores it" framing instead of deficit-focused language
- Make it crystal clear the tool provides cross-session memory and should be used before every task

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- MCP server now automatically installs npm dependencies on first startup via wrapper script
- Resolves "Cannot find module" errors for @modelcontextprotocol/sdk and native dependencies

### Added
- MCP server wrapper script (`cli/mcp-server-wrapper`) that auto-installs dependencies before starting
- esbuild bundling for MCP server to reduce dependency load time

### Changed
- MCP server now uses wrapper script instead of direct node execution
- Removed SessionStart ensure-dependencies hook (no longer needed)

### Removed
- `cli/ensure-dependencies` script (replaced by MCP server wrapper)

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- Pre-build and commit dist/ directory to avoid MCP server startup errors
- Remove dist/ from .gitignore to ensure built files are available after plugin install

### Changed
- Built JavaScript files now tracked in git for immediate plugin availability

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- Automatic dependency installation on plugin install via SessionStart hook
- `ensure-dependencies` script that checks and installs npm dependencies when needed

### Changed
- Plugin installation now automatically runs `npm install` if `node_modules` is missing
- Improved first-time plugin installation experience

### Fixed
- Plugin dependencies not being installed automatically after plugin installation

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- Initial release of episodic-memory
- Semantic search for Claude Code conversations
- MCP server integration for Claude Code
- Automatic session-end indexing via plugin hooks
- Multi-concept AND search for finding conversations matching all terms
- Unified CLI with commands: sync, search, show, stats, index
- Support for excluding conversations from indexing via DO NOT INDEX marker
- Comprehensive metadata tracking (session ID, git branch, thinking level, etc.)
- Both vector (semantic) and text (exact match) search modes
- Conversation display with markdown and HTML output formats
- Database verification and repair tools
- Full test suite with 71 tests

### Features
- **Search Modes**: Vector search, text search, or combined
- **Automatic Indexing**: SessionStart hook runs sync automatically
- **Privacy**: Exclude sensitive conversations from search index
- **Offline**: Uses local Transformers.js for embeddings (no API calls)
- **Fast**: SQLite with sqlite-vec for efficient similarity search
- **Rich Metadata**: Tracks project, date, git branch, Claude version, and more

### Components
- Core TypeScript library for indexing and searching
- CLI tools for manual operations
- MCP server for Claude Code integration
- Automatic search agent that triggers on relevant queries
- SessionStart hook for dependency installation and sync
