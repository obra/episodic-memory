 * Derive sync options from the process environment.

 * `EPISODIC_MEMORY_SKIP_SUMMARIES=1` turns the summarization pass off.
 * Only the exact string '1' enables the switch — unset, '0', 'true',
 * and anything else leave summarization on, so a stray value can't
 * silently disable a feature the user still expects.
 *
 * Why anyone wants this: summaries are display-only. search.ts reads
 * the `-summary.txt` sidecar solely to decorate result output; summary
 * text is never embedded and never searched, so skipping it leaves
 * recall untouched. The summarizer, by contrast, resumes each
 * conversation through the Claude Agent SDK, which spends the user's
 * Claude quota and can stall on a permission prompt.
